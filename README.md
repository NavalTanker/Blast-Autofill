# Project Title

A brief description of the project.

## Structure

This project is organized into the following layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: Handles user interaction.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Contains the core application logic.
- **Data Access Layer**: Manages data storage and retrieval.
- **Configuration**: Stores application settings.
- **Utilities**: Provides helper functions.
- **Tests**: Contains unit and integration tests.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Application

To run the main application script which demonstrates some basic interactions:
```bash
python app.py
```

The application output will show:
- Items being added directly via the repository.
- Data being processed by a service in the logic layer.
- Simulated CLI commands.
- Items being added and retrieved via services called from `app.py`.

To interact with the CLI directly (example):
```bash
python presentation/cli.py
```
You can then enter commands like `greet`, `add_item 10 MyCLIItem`, or `exit`.

## Running Tests

To run all tests:
```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

This will discover and run all test cases in the `tests` directory.
